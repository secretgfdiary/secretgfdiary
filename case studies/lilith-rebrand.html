                            <li>Upon the start of my services in February 2025, I established a new brand voice for Lilith’s pages.</li>
                            <li>Throughout March and April, I updated Lilith’s visual identity through changes in her makeup, clothing, and color grading in her content.</li>
                            <li>In April, Lilith’s VIP Page was put on a temporary hiatus to focus her Free Page’s Easter campaign.</li>
                            <li>In June, I switched over to work solely on Lilith’s VIP Page for her Birthday campaign. The Free Page was then put on hiatus during this time.</li>

                    <p class="text-paragraph">In late January 2025, I received a message with the opening line: <i>“Hey, I need your help.”</i> Intense, but straightforward, so I kept reading.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">The sender was Lilith, an OnlyFans creator who had seen my post on a job board for chatters, managers, and agencies. In the message, Lilith introduced herself, explained her situation, and pitched herself as a candidate for my services. After I finished reading her message, I audited her Reddit and OnlyFans pages.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">My professional opinion: <span class="text-b" style="color:red">they were really bad.</span> She needed a lot of help and it was very clear from the state of her pages. In spite of this, however, I saw potential. So after a few weeks of back-and-forth communication, we started working together for a major rebrand.</p>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">Lilith is an American woman in her mid-30s. She’s chubby, wears gothic makeup in her personal life, and has a sarcastic personality. On her pages, she sells solo and custom content.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Being chubby <i>and</i> goth, Lilith is fully aware that she doesn’t fit conventional beauty standards. But this isn’t a problem because her audience largely consists of North American Redditors who find her through NSFW subreddits for goth/alt girls and fat fetishes.</p><br>

                            <li>She has two OF pages: 1 VIP Page ($5/mo) + 1 Free Page ($0/mo)</li>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">Very soon after she created her OnlyFans accounts in 2023, she handed them off to be managed by different agencies.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Constantly switching managements posed the following problems:</p>
                        <ul class="list-unordered">
                            <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">Every time Lilith changed managements, her pages’ outward communications also changed.</span> This created visibly inconsistent writing styles in her post captions, mass messages, and private messages with fans.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">None of the previous managements’ writing styles represented Lilith’s key characteristics.</span> She’s an American goth woman in her mid-30s with an interesting personality, yet none of the agencies incorporated any signifiers of that in their work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-paragraph"><span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">It became too obvious that there were multiple, foreign parties running her pages, which shattered the illusion for fans who genuinely wanted to interact with the real her.</span> This broke the trust of her existing fans and made it nearly impossible to build any rapport with new ones. Very few fans converted to buyers, so Lilith’s sales suffered as a consequence of this mismanagement.</p>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">I chose this particular brand voice because overall, it sounds authentic. It leads with personality and resonates much
                        better with Lilith’s fans. The previous agencies’ writing style was generic and unnatural. Instead of channeling a desirable goth girl, it made her sound either like a bot or like a foreign customer representative.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">Within two weeks of implementing the new voice, Lilith’s pages started generating revenue again. By the end of March, her earnings nearly tripled from the beginning of the year.</p><br>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">Another issue I found in Lilith’s brand was her look: she was a chubby goth creator, but her content lacked the visual cues needed to succeed in those niches.</p>
                        <ul class="list-unordered">
                            <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She wore minimal makeup,</span> which contradicts the gothic subculture’s distinctly heavy makeup style.</li>
                            <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She often wore frilly, lace lingerie,</span> which doesn’t match her sharp personality.</li>
                            <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She edited her photos with a warm-toned filter,</span> which clashes with the subculture’s traditionally moody and desaturated aesthetic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">To amend these issues, I instructed Lilith to make three key changes, all of which were applied to both her OnlyFans content and her weekly traffic-generating posts on Reddit:</p>
                        <ul class="list-unordered">
                            <li>Wear <span class="text-b">heavy makeup</span> to look identifiably gothic,</li>
                            <li>Wear <span class="text-b">casual clothes and underwear</span> to reflect her personal style/personality, and</li>
                            <li>Apply <span class="text-b">cool-toned color grading</span> to all content (new and old) to match the niche aesthetic and emphasize her makeup better.</li>

						<p class="text-paragraph">To monetize Lilith’s rebrand, I executed targeted campaigns during select holidays. None of the previous agencies did this, and she had a lot of content that couldn’t sell in the past, so this would be a precedent I set.</p>
						<p class="text-paragraph">The campaigns I executed on her pages achieved three purposes, all of which were accomplished in the campaigns that took place in April and June:</p>

                        <p class="text-paragraph">For the entire month of April, Lilith’s Free Page focused on the holiday of Easter.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Central to this campaign was the <span class="text-b">Easter Egg Hunt</span> wall game. Each “egg” was numbered and had a different bundle inside. To play, fans tipped $15 on a pinned fundraising post to redeem their prize bundle. Fans could also submit multiple entries to redeem more prizes.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">In addition to the wall game, I also posted on Lilith’s Reddit profile once a week to get people to subscribe and participate in the Egg Hunt. All my posts focused on the campaign, emphasizing the fact that Lilith had lots of content
                        waiting to be seen by these users.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-m">Main Takeaways</h3>
                    <h4 class="heading-s">Authenticity sells.</h4>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">A successful [re]branding prioritizes authentic and cohesive alignment.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">The strategy behind Lilith’s rebrand was holistic—it centered her existing, natural identity as an unapologetically
                    chubby, goth American woman in her mid-30s. This was visually reinforced through her updated makeup, clothing, and content color-grading, all of which aligned with her target audience’s expectations and restored the trust that was lost from previous mismanagement. In all, these results prove that <span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">embracing a creator's unique qualities is the most effective strategy to profit on OnlyFans.</span></p><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading-s">Visual alignment is crucial.</h3>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">On OnlyFans, a creator’s “look” is a direct driver of success. <span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">To be successful, there must be visual alignment not just with a creator’s online personality, but also within their target niche(s).</span></p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Updating Lilith’s look resolved the aesthetic misalignments that contradicted her target audience’s preferences. Making
                    changes to her makeup, clothing, and content’s aesthetic helped her perform better within the chubby, goth, and
                    girl-next-door niches, resulting in greater audience interest, more page visits, and higher subscriber conversion rates.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading-s">Campaigns help you work smarter, not harder.</h3>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Executing sales campaigns comes with operational and financial benefits for creators.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">In Lilith’s case, the Easter and Birthday campaigns were “revenue hacks” that monetized her old content, showcased her glow-up, and proved her standing as a prolific creator who’s ready to serve her audience. The total net earnings for these months are also greater than the months that didn’t have any campaigns. This shows that <span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">campaigns are strong operational assets for creators to establish their authority and streamline their workflow.</span></p>
                    </div></div>

                    <div class="card">
                    <h3 class="heading-m">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">My work for Lilith demonstrates the importance of branding for NSFW creators. Success on OnlyFans is rooted in having a strong identity and building an equally strong relationship with a target audience. Lilith’s rebrand repaired the damage caused by prior mismanagement and restored her reputation within the chubby, goth, and girl-next-door niches. Repairing her reputation was crucial to the rebrand’s success.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Inconsistencies in messaging, weak aesthetics, and poor reputation management can be destructive. But when creators put in the work to build (or repair) their reputation, they unlock a new level of earning potential.</p>
