                        <p class="text-paragraph">One day in 2024, as I was putting together a monthly analytics report for September, I thought to myself: <i>“Damn…”</i> I didn’t have many positive things to write.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">September was a rough month for Allie, an OnlyFans creator I had started managing that summer. She and I had been
                        holding out hope that things would pick up after the “summertime slump” (those slow months in the industry when fans are outdoors and off their phones), but September wasn't different. In fact, the page had just hit a new low in net earnings.</p>
                        <p class="text-paragraph">Allie had been a top performer for so long, so what changed? Why were the sales that used to come so easily suddenly
                        drying up? To me, the numbers were clear: the old strategy was dead, and if we didn't update it soon, the decline would only continue.</p>

                    <p class="text-paragraph">Allie is a Latin American fitness influencer in her late 20s. She is known for having a voluptuous hourglass figure that’s muscular with a bit of “fluff” (i.e. chub).</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Allie’s main social media channels focus solely on fitness-related content. Her OnlyFans, however, highlights her sweet,
                    feminine, and flirty personality through <span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">non-nude content</span>. Her offerings include bikini and lingerie photo sets, try-on hauls, dancing, stripteases, and occasional fitness-themed content.</p><br>
                    <h5 class="heading-xs">Additional Facts</h5>
                    <ul class="list-unordered">
                        <li>She had been an OF creator since November 2023, managed by another agency until I took over in May 2024.</li>
                        <li>The majority of her audience/traffic comes from her Instagram.</li>

                    <h3 class="heading-m">The Client’s Issues</h3>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">When I took over Allie’s page in May, it was operating under a business model inherited from her previous agency. This
                    approach was largely directionless, relying on the high-volume scheduling of mass PPV messages (5-6 times daily) to
                    drive sales.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Although this generated consistent earnings initially (and reduced the labor of selling), <span class="text-b" style="color:red">it lacked a foundational brand
                    identity and long-term vision.</span> The strategy was improvisational and relied on Allie’s status as a fitness influencer making her debut on a “risque” platform to do the heavy lifting. But by September, the limitations of this strategy became apparent: after months of maintaining a $7.7K monthly net average, her net earnings dipped to $6.9K.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">This wasn't a random fluctuation; it was a symptom of audience fatigue. The data showed a significant drop in both open
                    and purchase rates for PPVs, signaling that the audience was losing interest for three critical reasons:</p>
                    <ul class="list-unordered">
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">Allie’s novelty wore off.</span> She could no longer rely on the initial mystique of being an influencer-turned-OF girl; now she needed to give her fans a good reason to stay.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">Allie doesn’t offer any nude or sexual content.</span> When Allie debuted as an OF creator, her newness brought her a lot of patience from her fans. They were willing to overlook her firm boundary because the novelty of her presence was strong enough for some time. But when that wore off, so did the audience's tolerance. Without the “new girl” hype, they became increasingly frustrated by the lack of sexual
                        content. This led to a decline in sales, tips, and retention.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">Allie didn’t consistently produce content.</span> There were frequent—and weeks-long—delays in populating our internal content library (shared between her and I). This limited my options on what I could sell on her page and forced me to recycle old ideas that her fans stopped caring for.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-paragraph"><span class="text-b" style="background-color: #fbe6a2">The previous agency’s “good enough” approach had reached its limit, leaving the page vulnerable to a downward spiral.</span> It worked in the past, but I had to make major changes to prevent her page from declining any further.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-xl">How I Successfully Updated the Client’s Strategy</h3><br>
        <div class="heading-s">To save Allie’s page, I pivoted from a volume-based model to a <span class="heading-services">brand-equity model</span>. I updated her content strategy to position her as a “flirty influencer” and to move away from the “basic girl” vibe she originally had.</div>
        <div class="heading-s"><span style="background-color: #fbe6a2">No more vague promises of companionship</span>—instead, the new strategy promised the audience high-quality content and, most importantly, followed through.</div>
        <div class="heading-s">This promise was fulfilled by:</div><br>

        <ol class="list-ordered">
            <li class="heading-s">Expanding her breadth of content to include <span class="heading-services">long-form and more niche videos</span></li>
            <li class="heading-s">Improving the aesthetic and thematic quality of all video content through <span class="heading-services">post-production editing</span></li>
            <li class="heading-s">Executing strategic <span class="heading-services">sales campaigns</span></li>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="heading-s">My approach ultimately sustained long-term interest for her without compromising Allie’s boundaries.</div><br>
        <div class="heading-lg" align="center">***</div>
        <br>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4 class="heading-m">Expansion of Content Breadth</h4>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">To steer Allie's page in the right direction, I instructed her to film <span class="text-b">long-form, fitness-related videos</span> such as body checks, workouts, and warmup/cooldown stretches.</p>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">This leveraged her established authority as a fitness influencer while maintaining a clear distinction between her public (Instagram) and private (OnlyFans) brands. This distinction was further enforced through the setting, wardrobe, and narrative continuity in the new OF content.</p><br>
                    <ul class="list-unordered">
                        <li><span class="heading-xs">Setting and Wardrobe</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Allie’s IG content focused on gym-based training in athletic sets, her OF content highlighted an <span class="text-b">intimate, at-home setting</span> and featured a <span class="text-b">“flirty” wardrobe</span> of bikinis and casual underwear.</li>
                        <li><span class="heading-xs">Narrative Continuity</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allie’s new “get ready with me” (GRWM) and try-on videos bridged her two worlds: IG and OF. By filming herself <span class="text-b">dressing in and out of the exact gym clothes seen in her IG posts</span>, we created a narrative link to her OF content. This continuity transformed her public fitness content into an organic teaser for her OF. Conversely, her OF content visually referenced her IG outfits, encouraging the fans to engage on both platforms.</li>
                        <li><span class="heading-xs">Format</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under previous management, Allie’s longest videos were no longer than 1 minute. The new content strategy introduced
                        <span class="text-b">long-form, 3-10 minute follow-along workout and stretching videos</span>. This also gave more value to her OF content since her IG videos are only 15-30 seconds long.</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    <h5 class="heading-xs">Results</h5>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">Framing Allie’s OF fitness content as exclusive, flirty videos transformed her athleticism into a form of curated intimacy.
                    This established a clear focus for her page and allowed it to remain profitable without relying on explicit nudity. The long-form videos also allowed for higher price points, so they generated more earnings per video. Ultimately, all of these changes increased the fans’ lifetime value (LTV) by driving more first-time and repeat purchases across the board.</p><br>

                    <p class="text-paragraph">Another issue I found in Lilith’s brand was her look: she was a chubby
                        goth creator, but her content lacked the visual cues needed to succeed in those niches.</p>
                    <ul class="list-unordered">
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She wore minimal makeup,</span> which contradicts the
                            gothic subculture’s distinctly heavy makeup style.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She often wore frilly, lace lingerie,</span> which
                            doesn’t match her sharp personality.</li>
                        <li><span class="text-b" style="color:red">She edited her photos with a warm-toned
                                filter,</span> which clashes with the subculture’s traditionally moody and desaturated
                            aesthetic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-paragraph">To amend these issues, I instructed Lilith to make three key changes, all
                        of which were applied to both her OnlyFans content and her weekly traffic-generating posts on
                        Reddit:</p>

                            match the niche aesthetic and emphasize her makeup better.</li>
